The major purpose of applying for the financial aid that I am currently unable to pay the fees for this course.
I am a regular student of computer science master's and there is no source of income which i can invest to do a online course on coursera. 
When i come to know about this initiative by Coursera, i opted for the same. 
By choosing this i am committing that i'll complete this course by submitting all the assignments and quizzes. 
This is the gateway for students who want to learn something but the problem is they can't pay, 
so i am really grateful to coursera for providing a chance that would be going to shape us by knowledge and skills. 
I am already taken the course 1-Programming for Everybody (Getting Started with Python) from Python for Everybody Specialization 
& want to continue with the next recommended course to grab more to enhance my skill quality towards python programming language.  
so this is the only visible way or an opportunity to learn this topic by a very best from the same field, 
so please i am requesting again for this financial aid. 
This could be a major breakthrough in my career.

Learning has always been a passage for change when it is implemented for solving a real life problem. 
This motto drives me to do this course because this course gives a thorough insight through the subject. 
By signing up for this course, i am sure that this course will help me towards my aims of developing a good programming skill. 
To excel in network automation this course will serve as a great launchpad. 

Technology is future and it also can change the future by implementing this properly. 
Learning is important but having a great insight into such a fundamental topic of computer science is more vital and 
that's why i'm also eager for such type of thing imbibed into my learning, this will be very helpful for me.
